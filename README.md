# ⚙️ 3-Speed Gear Mechanism Prototype

## 📌 Project Overview

The **3-Speed Gear Mechanism Prototype** is an ongoing academic project focused on designing and fabricating a manually operated gear transmission system. The goal is to simulate a basic **3-speed gear train** using **nylon gears** mounted on a **wooden base**, suitable for demonstration and learning purposes.

This model aims to showcase the fundamentals of gear ratio selection, transmission layout, and mechanical design, making it ideal for educational labs and mechanical workshops.
